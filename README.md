### Pizza Menu
This project is an interactive menu that allows the user to order a pizza by selecting the size and various toppings. It then takes the input provided from the user and calculates the price for the order. The order and total are then displayed on the menu page. 

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The user plays as X's and the computer plays as O's. A sound is played each time a tile is placed on the board. If there are three X's or three O's in a row, a green line is drawn across the winning tiles and music is played to indicate the game has been won. Then the board resets for the next round to be played. If no player wins, different music plays to signal that there is a tie, then the board resets for the next round. 

### Calculator
This is a basic 4-function calculator that allows users to add, subtract, multiply, and divide using an online calculator. 

### Pawsitivity Site
This is an example home page for a company called Pawsitivity that allows people to schedule visits with other people's dogs. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form. JavaScript is used to provide an interactive lightbox that allows users to click on a thumbnail and view a larger image. The user can then navigate through the larger images using previous and next arrows or exit by clicking on the 'X'. 

### Movie Theater Site
This page is an example home page for a movie theater called Academy Cinemas that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains various Bootstrap components such as a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns, etc. Other Bootstrap features added include a carousel that shows coming attractions, a form modal where users can sign up for monthly movie deals, and popover over the sign up button that displays information about what the user is signing up for.
